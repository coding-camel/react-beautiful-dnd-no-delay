### Overview

The problem: dragging a handle with no delay is not possible on touch devices.

This package fixes it by seting `timeForLongPress` to 0.

It's a temporary fix until we get an official solution.

### How to use:

1. `npm uninstall react-beautiful-dnd`

2. `npm i coding-camel/react-beautiful-dnd-instant`

All existing imports will still work.

### Changelog:

16 May 2021: Updated to v13.1.0

30 July 2020: Released with v13.0.0
